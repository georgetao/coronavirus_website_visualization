# Coronavirus Visualization
Welcome to Jeremiah Joseph Sahabu, Natalie Wang, and George Tao's vizualization project focused on COVID-19. The website can be found at: http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~georgetao/w209/index.html

We have three main tasks for this visualization: comparing to other pandemics.

##Exploring Growth Trends of COVID-19 - Jeremiah Joseph Sahabu
The primary goal was to explore how COVID-19 grew in different countries. Visualizations were created to show how far along each country is regarding its COVID-19 timeline. Additionally, by creating compelling visualizations, we can help educate the public about how dangerous this pandemic actually is.


##Comparing Country Responses - Natalie Wang
The primary goal was to analyze how different countries responsed to COVID-19. Some countries are further along the recovery process than others, so by analyzing and comparing responses, we hope to better understand how certain enforced measures affect COVID-19 growth rates.


##Comparing to Other Pandemics - George Tao
The primary goal here was to compare trends of COVID-19 against trends of other pandemics to try and make predictions and gain insights about the future of COVID-19. By comparing against other pandemics, we can paint a better picture of how deadly COVID-19 is with regards to other known diseases.
